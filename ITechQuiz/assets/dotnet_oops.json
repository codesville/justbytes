Inheritance: In object oriented programming classes can inherit some common behavior and state from others.

				{"category":".NET","topic_id":"12","question":"Can you prevent a class from overriding ?","answer":"If you define a class as 'Sealed' in C# and 'NotInheritable' in VB.NET you can inherit the class any further."},
